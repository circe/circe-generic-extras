This library provides configurable generic derivation and other functionality extending the generic
derivation mechanisms provided in [Circe][circe]'s circe-generic module.
The circe-generic-extras module used to be included in the core Circe repository, but it was moved
to this separate repository after 0.12.1, in preparation for Circe's 1.0.0 release.

This library is experimental and its development is primarily community-supported.

## Usage

This library as functionality to parse JSON in different cased formats such as `snake_case`, `kabeb-case` or `PascalCase`.

You can enable different case modes by making a custom configuration.

```json
{
  "foo-bar": "foobar"
}
```

```scala
import io.circe.generic.extras.semiauto._
import io.circe.generic.extras.Configuration

case class Foo(fooBar: String)

implicit val customConfig: Configuration = Configuration.default.withKebabCaseMemberNames

implicit val fooEncoder: Encoder[Foo] = deriveEncoder
implicit val fooDecoder: Decoder[Foo] = deriveDecoder
```
