This library provides configurable generic derivation and other functionality extending the generic
derivation mechanisms provided in [Circe][circe]'s circe-generic module.
The circe-generic-extras module used to be included in the core Circe repository, but it was moved
to this separate repository after 0.12.1, in preparation for Circe's 1.0.0 release.

This library is experimental and its development is primarily community-supported.
